# POST-IT!

## Overview

The **Cross-Platform Post Embedder Bot** is a Discord bot designed to unify and simplify the process of sharing media from multiple platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Mastodon, and more

## Planned Platforms

- Reddit
- X (f.k.a. Twitter)
- Tumblr
- Mastodon
- Other social media platforms to be added in future releases

## How It Works

1. **Post Link Submission:** Users provide a link to a post from a supported platform.
2. **Embed Generation:** The bot fetches the content of the post (e.g. images, text) and generates a standardized Discord embed.
3. **Customization:** Depending on user or server settings, the format of the embed can vary, allowing for a personalized experience.
